# hello-world

"The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming", so this is my simple exercise to get started with GitHub learning from official GitHub guides (No online courses)!!!

Hey programmers!
Riller here, I'd like to build something cool to play what is a game development project.
Therefore, I also like web and mobile development, however, I've been thinking too much in UNITY 3D and BLENDER.
To put my mind at ease, I decided to learn a bunch of things about modeling objects, animations and game design!

Get ready, perhaps you might see a simple project made by me in the future!
