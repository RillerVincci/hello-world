# hello-world

"The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming", so this is my simple exercise to get started with GitHub learning from official GitHub guides (No online courses)!!!

Hey programmers, Riller here!!!

I had like to build something cool, then I thought about a game development project to have fun and enjoy my hobby.
Moreover, I also like web and mobile development, however, I have been thinking too much in game dev including technologies like UNITY3D and BLENDER. 
Wow... after being overloaded, I decided to put my mind at ease, so I started learning a bunch of things about modeling objects, animations and game design. 

I have a simple prototype made on unity. Contact me if you want to know it!!! 

Hurry up. Perhaps you will see a simple and good game project made by me in the future!
